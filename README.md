System size expansion analysis of controlled, heteroplasmic mtDNA populations

Work in progress! Cataloguing of code for the analysis in https://www.cell.com/ajhg/fulltext/S0002-9297(16)30397-4
Johnston & Jones, "Evolution of Cell-to-Cell Variability in Stochastic, Controlled, Heteroplasmic mtDNA Populations"

This cataloguing isn't complete yet, nor is the code fully commented!

Current contents: two Mathematica notebooks containing analyses for general control law and several specific cases
